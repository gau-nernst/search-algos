# search-algos
 
Implement basic search algorithms in Python

Implemented algorithms:
- Breadth-first search
- Depth-first search
- Depth-limited DFS
- Iterative-deepening DFS
- Greedy search (required some changes)
- A* search

The notebook `map_search.ipynb` shows how the algorithms perform in a map searching problem. Travelling time and coordinates were obtained from Google Maps manually.

# Dependencies

`search.py` itself has no depenencies. However, the `map_search.ipynb` notebook uses `matplotlib` to visualize the Singapore map.

To install `matplotlib`, use either `pip` or `conda`

```python
pip install matplotlib
```
